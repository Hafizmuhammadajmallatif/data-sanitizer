Secure Data Sanitization Tool
An educational Python tool demonstrating secure file deletion techniques and data sanitization
methods.
âš  WARNING
This tool PERMANENTLY DESTROYS data. Deleted files CANNOT be recovered. Use with
extreme caution and always maintain backups of important data.
Overview
This tool demonstrates various secure deletion algorithms used to prevent data recovery. It's designed
for educational purposes to understand how secure deletion works and why standard file deletion isn't
secure.
Features
Multiple Overwrite Methods:
Single pass (zeros/ones/random)
DoD 5220.22-M (3-pass and 7-pass)
Gutmann 35-pass method
Security Features:
Cryptographically secure random data generation
File system cache flushing
Metadata obscuration through renaming
Free space wiping capability
Educational Components:
Detailed information about each deletion method
Recovery prevention explanations
Platform-specific considerations

1. Standard File Deletion (Insecure)
Operating system only removes file system references
Data remains on disk until overwritten
Can be easily recovered with undelete tools
2. Secure Overwriting
Writes patterns over the original data multiple times
Different patterns target various storage technologies
Makes data recovery extremely difficult or impossible
3. Metadata Removal
Renames file to random name before deletion
Obscures original filename from file system journals
Security Considerations
Hard Disk Drives (HDDs)
Overwriting is generally effective
Multiple passes increase security
Magnetic remnance theoretically possible but practically difficult
Solid State Drives (SSDs)
Wear leveling may leave data copies
TRIM commands complicate secure deletion
Controller may move data internally
Recommend using manufacturer's secure erase command
File Systems
NTFS (Windows): Shadow copies may retain data
APFS (macOS): Copy-on-write may preserve old versions
ext4 (Linux): Journal may contain file metadata
Best Practices
. Use full-disk encryption to protect data at rest
. For SSDs, use manufacturer secure erase tools when possible
. Physical destruction is the only 100% secure method
. Consider the sensitivity of data when choosing method
Limitations
. Not suitable for SSDs: Due to wear leveling and internal controller behavior
. Cannot wipe slack space: File system may store data in unreachable areas
. No memory wiping: RAM may contain sensitive data
. Limited free space wiping: Simplified implementation
Educational Purpose
This tool is designed to:
Demonstrate secure deletion concepts
Show why standard deletion is insecure
Educate about data persistence
Illustrate different overwriting algorithms
Ethical Use
Only use on files and systems you own
Respect privacy and data protection laws
Do not use to destroy evidence
Consider environmental impact of physical destruction
